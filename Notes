Two types of users
- Customer
- Admin

On registration a new user is added to the 'customer' group.
A user can only be added to the 'admin' group from the Django admin site.

The admin and the customer have different dashboard.
When a customer signs up via the registration page, the customer is redirected to the login page and is shown a success message.
When a customer logs in, the customer is redirected to the customer dashboard, but when an admin logs in, the admin is redirected to the admin dashboard.

Going to the registration page when logged in
- if a customer tries to access the registration page via the url, the customer is automatically taken back to the customer's dashboard via the custom decorator.
- if an admin tries to access the registration page via the url, the admin is automatically taken back to the admin' dashboard via the custom decorator.

Going to the login page when logged in
- if a customer tries to access the login page via the url, the customer is automatically taken back to the customer's dashboard via the custom decorator.
- if an admin tries to access the login page via the url, the admin is automatically taken back to the admin' dashboard via the custom decorator.
